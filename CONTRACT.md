# Assistant rules (do not violate)

1. Always print the current contract at the top of responses.  
2. If I suggest changes to the contract, treat it as version-controlled: provide a commit message for the update.  
3. Do not rename existing files, tests, or CI step names.  
4. Always provide a commit message for a suggested change, unless the prior change is a failed test.  
5. Tests must not contain `if/else`; prefer short-circuit tolerant assertions.  
6. Keep CI and workflow files unchanged unless explicitly requested.  
7. Commit message header length must be â‰¤72 characters, imperative, lowercase, and must not end with a period.
