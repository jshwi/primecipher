# Assistant rules (do not violate)
- Do not rename existing files/tests/CI step names.
- Do not suggest commit messages unless tests have just passed.
- Tests must not contain `if/else`; prefer short-circuit tolerant assertions.
- Keep CI and workflow files unchanged unless explicitly requested.
- Treat any failing test output as “previous message revoked.”
